# Recognition rather than recall

Minimize the userâ€™s memory load by making objects, actions, and options visible. The user should not have to remember information from one part of the dialogue to another. Instructions for use of the system should be visible or easily retrievable whenever appropriate.

A good example are airline websites which need to keep all the information that the user has selected in a previous step visible, such that the user is confident that they are making the right booking

## Counterexamples
### Unrecognizable Icons 
Emma: After very light use, the buttons on my toaster disappeared (they should have made sure the icons were more permanent). For the last couple of years, I have just pressed a random button. I just realized, that the only button that actually means "toast this bread" is the last one. The one that is still visible, because I have never used it. I have been defrosting bread for years - apparently.

### Confusing instructions
Mads: When going from one lecture to another in the ITU building, one might want to dispose of some trash. These are the trash cans that are provided. It is however often in a moment when passing by and sometimes in a hurry. I have not yet been able to memorize what goes where, and throwing items out can at times feel like a game of rock, paper, scissor.
